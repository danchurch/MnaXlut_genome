## so here we'll muck around with bowtie, see if we can get the F2 hybrid reads 
## talking to the luteus genome:

genome='/Users/danthomas/Documents/naiandinus_gen/Luteus_genome/Mimulus_luteus.faa'

## shortcut to instructions/scripts from Josh
cd /Users/danthomas/Documents/naiandinus_gen/for_dan/Call_SNPs

bowtie2 -I 150 -X 2000 --local --very-sensitive-local -x $genome -1 $i -2 $file2 

## huh, looks like josh had R2 reads.. where are these?

## looks like I will not know until Josh gets back to us. In the 
## meantime, maybe we can run through a tutorial on the bowtie2 process...

## we'll put the whole bowtie2 directory nearby and work in it, cuz they
## have all the reads and genomes in it...

## let's follow the manual tutorial for bowtie2:

## http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml#getting-started-with-bowtie-2-lambda-phage-example

BT2_HOME=/Users/danthomas/Documents/naiandinus_gen/bowtie2-2.3.4.1-macos-x86_64

## now we make an index file:

mkdir tutorial
cd tutorial
mkdir lambda_ind
cd lambda_ind

$BT2_HOME/bowtie2-build $BT2_HOME/example/reference/lambda_virus.fa lambda_virus

## this makes a set of indices from the reference genome. 
## after this, you don't need the originial reference fasta

## now align some reads:

$BT2_HOME/bowtie2 -x lambda_ind -U $BT2_HOME/example/reads/reads_1.fq -S eg1.sam



## side note, install SAMtools: ##

cd samtools.1.8  

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/bin

make

make install

######### Samtools: ###########

samtools view -bS eg1.sam > eg1.bam

## and other cool stuff. Try this with our genome?

## josh's script:

cd /Volumes/Ron/VCF
mkdir ./BAM
genome=/Volumes/Ron/VCF/Reference/LF10T
flag=Flag_Z002_$1.log

for i in /Volumes/Ron/VCF/fastq/$1/*R1*.fastq; do

done

echo "Bowtie2 for $1 done: " $(date) >> $flag


## looks like he had both R1 and R2 reads. How come ours are all labeled R1?


## looks like josh did in fact merge paired ends. I can't reconstruct, I don't seem 
## to have the R2s

## but why are all of the reads lumped into one large merged file?

## and what are these fastqs? Different colors of F2 offspring? 

## does that mean we need to demultiplex?

## lets look:

cool='/Users/danthomas/Documents/naiandinus_gen/for_dan/Cooley_3315_160429B1'

cd $cool

fr i in *fastq; do echo $(head -n 1 $i) $i; done

## okay, talked to Josh - there are no reverse reads, josh included some 
## extra scripts in the files...

########## plot read quality of one of the fastq files: #############

## can we get a good look at the read quality:


for i in $fpath*"fastq"
do
echo $i
$ftd"fastx_quality_stats" -Q33 -i $i -o $i"-Stats.txt"
echo $i done!
done

## while we're at it, get fastx tools into path

cd /usr/local/Cellar/fastxtools/

cd /usr/local/bin

for i in /usr/local/Cellar/fastxtools/*; do
    ln -s $i /usr/local/bin$(basename $i)
done

## next time should be easier

## what do these look like?

fpath='/Users/danthomas/Documents/naiandinus_gen/for_dan/Cooley_3315_160429B1/'

fastq_quality_boxplot_graph.sh -h

for i in $fpath*Stats.txt; do
echo $i
#fastq_quality_boxplot_graph.sh -i $i -o $i"quality.eps" -p
echo $i"quality.eps"
done

## huh, not sure if I did that right, cuz they all look the same...

## but they are all high quality, if they are right. Something is fishy, don't 
## think I can trust these stats, because they are totally uniform, no variation 
## in the qscores of the millions of reads? weird. Maybe this is normal for 
## genomic work?



## oh well, let's try an alignment:

######### as per josh

cd /Volumes/Ron/VCF
mkdir ./BAM

## okay, got the BAMs. Now what?

## Josh did this next:

cd /Volumes/Ron/VCF
flag=Flag_Z004_$1.log

for i in ./BAM/$1*.bam; do
    output="${i/.bam/.FM.bam}"
    [ -e "$i" ] && picard FixMateInformation I=$i O=$output SO=coordinate || echo "There was a problem with Z004 for $1" >> $flag
    rm $i
done

## what is picard? a package of tools for hnadling hi-throughput result files like BAMs
## sounds handy. So what does fixMateInformation do?

## looks like it checks headers of reads to make sure the right
## reads got paired, etc. But we didn't merge paired ends, soo, 
## need this? don't think so...

## gotta sort these BAMs, apparently

## sort by coordinate position in the reference genome:

## sortBAMs.sh
###############

cd /Users/danthomas/Documents/naiandinus_gen/BAM

touch sortBAMs_log.txt 

for i in *
do
    ls $i
    output="sortedBAM/"${i/.bam/.sorted.bam}
    picard SortSam I=$i O=$output SORT_ORDER=coordinate \
    && echo $output finished >> markdupe_log.txt || echo "Something's fucked with "$output >> markdupe_log.txt
done

##################

time ./sortBAMS.sh





## so next josh did this:

less /Users/danthomas/Documents/naiandinus_gen/for_dan/Call_SNPs/readme.txt

## PicardMarkDupes.sh

for i in ./BAM/$1*.FM.bam; do
    output="${i/.FM.bam/.MD.bam}"
    [ -e "$i" ] && picard MarkDuplicates I=$i O=$output M=$output.metrics.txt REMOVE_DUPLICATES=true MAX_FILE_HANDLES_FOR_READ_ENDS_MAP=1000 || echo "There was a problem with Z005 for $1 " >> $flag
##    rm $i
done

## I'm a little unclear on this. I can see why removing duplicates is handy. 
## Dereplicating the redundant information in duplicates makes sense 
## as far as computational expense. But the explanation in picard's manual
## implies that all duplicates are erroroneous reads - how can this be 
## true? Presumably the same digestion site occurs several times, gets 
## sequenced? Maybe the sites of digestion are random, so it is really
## unlikely that a sequence would happen twice. 

## not sure, anyway, just following orders like a good scientist...


## josh's command:

## picard MarkDuplicates I=$i O=$output M=$output.metrics.txt REMOVE_DUPLICATES=true MAX_FILE_HANDLES_FOR_READ_ENDS_MAP=1000 

## the max_file_handles parameter... manual says that this sets a limit on 
## the number of open files for this process, because there is a limit permitted
## by the kernel. Can be found on our comp with:

ulimit -n ## 256 files

## that's a LOT less than the default setting of 8000, and what Josh 
## used (he was on a cluster?). So one of our commands would look like this?


sbam="/Users/danthomas/Documents/naiandinus_gen/BAM/sortedBAM"

ddm="/Users/danthomas/Documents/naiandinus_gen/BAM/dmBAM/"

echo $ddm$output

cd $sbam
picard MarkDuplicates I=$i O=$ddm$output M=$output.metrics.txt REMOVE_DUPLICATES=true MAX_FILE_HANDLES_FOR_READ_ENDS_MAP=256

## josh's example is as such:

picard AddOrReplaceReadGroups I=$i O=$output RGPL=illumina RGPU=indexSEQ RGID=90210 RGLB=A_Library RGSM=$1 

## looks like he fills in the rg fields with some metadata and keeps the phenotype binning in the 
## RGSM field (Read Group Sample Name)

## 


## one of our reads has this:

## let's look at one of our SAM files, see what the read group info is:

samtools view -H /Users/danthomas/Documents/naiandinus_gen/SAM/JP-S1_S16_L002_R1_001.sam | grep '@RG'
samtools view -H /Users/danthomas/Documents/naiandinus_gen/SAM/JP-S1_S16_L002_R1_001.sam | head

## doesn't exist. I guess that's why we have to add it now. 

## for one of our reads:

cd /Users/danthomas/Documents/naiandinus_gen/BAM/dmBAM

#### then he uses the basename of the last $i assigned to make file name for the merged file:

#####################


## indexing, other prep

## Looks like I need to make a proper reference genome, can't just use the fasta
## as is. How to do this?

genome="/Users/danthomas/Documents/naiandinus_gen/Luteus_genome/Mimulus_luteus.fasta"
 
cd /Users/danthomas/Documents/naiandinus_gen/Luteus_genome/

## make dictionary of reference sequences
picard CreateSequenceDictionary REFERENCE=$genome OUTPUT=Mimulus_luteus.dict

## use make a samtools-type index
samtools faidx Mimulus_luteus.fasta

faidx="/Users/danthomas/Documents/naiandinus_gen/Luteus_genome/Mimulus_luteus.fasta.fai"

## and... also have to index our bam file?:

cd /Users/danthomas/Documents/naiandinus_gen/BAM/

samtools index /Users/danthomas/Documents/naiandinus_gen/BAM/Mll_x_MN.merged.bam
## I think if I keep this in the same directory as the 
## BAM I am analyzing, I don't need a separate shortcut to it...

## (I changed our genome name from ".fa" to ".fasta". This is going to mess with upstream
## code...oh well, onward)

## the next step needs the GATK tools, which are jar files. 

## but as I understand it, we don't need to call the jar files themselves, there's a wrapper script that 
## linked to our usr/local/bin folder. 

## not sure what ploidy to use here, technically tetraploid but functionally diploid

## Josh's script:

## java -Xmx30g -jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar -R $genome -T UnifiedGenotyper -rf MaxInsertSize --maxInsertSize 10000 -rf DuplicateRead -rf BadMate -rf BadCigar --min_base_quality_score 25 -rf MappingQuality --min_mapping_quality_score 25 -ploidy 2 --genotype_likelihoods_model BOTH --output_mode EMIT_ALL_SITES --max_alternate_alleles 2 $str -o $out

## Let's try this with ploidy = 2

## the unified genotyper is deprecated, use HaplotypeCaller


## so to map the variants...

## ours might look like:

genome="/Users/danthomas/Documents/naiandinus_gen/Luteus_genome/Mimulus_luteus.fasta"
merged="/Users/danthomas/Documents/naiandinus_gen/BAM/Mll_x_MN.merged.bam"
out="/Users/danthomas/Documents/naiandinus_gen/Mll_x_MN.merged.ver0.1.vcf"


GATK HaplotypeCaller \

    -I $merged \
    -O $out

    -ERC GVCF \
    -rf MaxInsertSize \
    --maxInsertSize 10000 \
    -ploidy 2 \

## deleted mapping quality filters, because there is some kind of default mapping quality filter 
## in the haplotyper, "HCMappingQualityFilter"


gatk HaplotypeCaller -R

## questions for josh 

## best to merge our different BAMs into one to make this comparison? Does it matter?

## do we need to set this: --max_alternate_alleles 2 $str  

## don't we want the whole genome? as in, some sort of gvcf file? 


picard ValidateSamFile I=$merged MODE=SUMMARY 

## no errors found. Well, shit. What's wrong?


## anyway, this is running:

## I get the following error, endlessly:

"""

"""


GATK HaplotypeCaller \
    -R $genome \
    -I $merged \
    -O $out

## seems to have worked ....



################### 

## okay, can we use this VCF to reconstruct a 
## draft M. naiandinus genome? Let's try the 
## FastaAlternateReferenceMaker tool 



## gatk says use like this:
## java -jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar \
##    -R reference.fasta \
##    -o output.fasta \
##    -L input.intervals \
##    -V input.vcf \

## but gatk isn't finding that program...hmm... online folks are still using it...

type -a gatk   ## gatk is /usr/local/bin/gatk, which is a symlink to /usr/local/Cellar/gatk-4.0.3.0/gatk

cd /usr/local/Cellar/gatk-4.0.3.0/gatk

##example:
java -jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar -R ../human_g1k_v37.fasta -T FastaAlternateReferenceMaker

## ours?
java -jar gatk-package-4.0.3.0-local.jar -T FastaAlternateReferenceMaker -R $reference -o $output -V $vcf

## not working. GenomeAnalysisTK.jar - is this different than our gatk-package?


## well, this tool ("FastaAlternateReferenceMaker") isn't in the current, 4.0 version of GATK. 
## let's see if we can get the 3.8 version going...

## okay, the old  3.8 gatk is installed in the cellar. I guess we need to symlink to it, cuz it's 
## not technically a binary, is a file that the java interpreter calls...

ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/GenomeAnalysisTK-3.8/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar


## does it work?

reference="/Users/danthomas/Documents/naiandinus_gen/Luteus_genome/Mimulus_luteus.fasta"
vcf="/Users/danthomas/Documents/naiandinus_gen/Mll_x_MN.merged.ver0.1.vcf"
output="/Users/danthomas/Documents/naiandinus_gen/Mn_v0.1.fasta"

java -jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar -T FastaAlternateReferenceMaker -R $reference -o $output -V $vcf 

## compare to our luteus genome:

luteus='/Users/danthomas/Documents/naiandinus_gen/Luteus_genome/Mimulus_luteus.fasta'

wc -l Mn_v0.1.fasta
wc -l $luteus

head Mn_v0.1.fasta
head $luteus

tail Mn_v0.1.fasta
tail $luteus

## number of scaffolds the same?

grep ">" Mn_v0.1.fasta | wc -l
grep ">" $luteus | wc -l

## looks like it

## not sure how to sanity check this. 

## can we get some scaffolds of interest?

## I see a couple options. Look at the scaffolds we know in genius, see if they make 
## sense.

## or get a local install of blast going, look for the myb genes in it


########## local blast ###########


## make our database
makeblastdb -in Mn_v0.1.fasta -parse_seqids -dbtype nucl

## let's look for our myb5a gene, taken from a sequence in the geneious database that claims to be exon1 of myb5 of the Mll scaffold 1235

exon1myb5="TGGAAAACACACCTGTAGGTGTAAGAAAAGGTGCATGGTCCACAGAAGAAGACGTACTCCTGAGGAAATGCATTGAGAATTTTGGTGAAGGAAAATGGCATCTTGTACCTCTTAGAGCAG"

echo ${#exon1myb5} ## 120 bp

blastn -query <(echo $exon1myb5) -db Mn_v0.1.fasta -outfmt 6 -num_alignments 3 -num_descriptions 3 -out test.txt -task blastn

## the headers for this format: qseqid sseqid pident length mismatch gapopen qstart qend sstart send evalue bitscore

cat test.txt

## huh, does that mean this exon matches exactly to something on scaffold 1211? 

grep "1211" Mn_v0.1.fasta 
## nope, the naiandinus genome has its own sequence numbers,
## they are labeled with the scaffold that they came from in the original Luteus genome
## in this case, goes to scaffold 1235 of the luteus genome. Makes sense.


grep "731" Mn_v0.1.fasta 
## same here, equivalent to scaffold 749 of Mll 

## so let's see, are these numbers more or less equivalent? So if we extract just this 
## sequence, is it M. naiandinus's version of the mll scaffold 1235?:

grep ">1211" Mn_v0.1.fasta 

grep -n ">1211" Mn_v0.1.fasta ## line 5672165
